**Decentralized File Storage on Shelby Protocol (Aptos Blockchain)**

Seedio is a Web3 dApp that lets users securely upload, store, and manage files on Shelby's decentralized storage network — powered by Aptos wallet authentication and cryptographic commitments on-chain.

## 📖 Overview

Traditional cloud storage relies on centralized servers that can go down, get censored, or be controlled by a single provider. **Seedio** demonstrates a different model — files are erasure-coded, cryptographically committed, and distributed across a decentralized network of storage providers on **Shelby Protocol**, with ownership and integrity anchored on the **Aptos blockchain**.

This project was built to explore real-world Web3 storage infrastructure connecting a live Aptos wallet, signing on-chain transactions, and interacting directly with Shelby's testnet.

## ❓ Why Shelby?

Shelby Protocol was chosen as the storage layer for this project because it offers:

- **Verifiable, cryptographically committed storage** — every file's integrity is provable via Merkle root commitments registered on-chain
- **Erasure-coded resilience** — files are split into chunksets and chunks, so no single point of failure can destroy or corrupt data
- **Aptos-native architecture** — built directly on Aptos using Move smart contracts, offering high throughput and low latency
- **Read-intensive, low-latency design** — purpose-built for real Web3 use cases like media, datasets, and collaborative apps, not just static backups

Building on Shelby gave a practical, hands-on way to learn decentralized storage architecture instead of just reading about it.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Aptos Wallet Integration** — Connect via Petra Wallet using the official Aptos Wallet Adapter
- 📤 **File Upload** — Upload files to Shelby's decentralized storage network (Shelbynet Testnet)
- 📁 **File Management** — View, organize, and track previously uploaded files
- 🔒 **Access Control Options** — Choose between encrypted, public, and private storage types
- 🎨 **Modern Web3 UI** — Dark theme, multiple color palettes, smooth animations, fully responsive
- 🌐 **On-chain Verification** — Every upload is backed by a cryptographic commitment hash registered on Aptos

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** — User connects their Aptos-compatible wallet (Petra) via the official Aptos Wallet Adapter
2. **Select File** — User chooses a file to upload through drag-and-drop or file picker
3. **Erasure Coding** — The file is split into chunksets and encoded using Clay erasure codes for redundancy
4. **Commitment & Signing** — A cryptographic commitment (Merkle root) is generated and signed via the connected wallet
5. **On-chain Registration** — The commitment is registered on the Aptos blockchain through a signed transaction
6. **Distributed Upload** — Encoded chunks are transmitted to Shelby's decentralized storage providers
7. **Verification** — Users can view their uploaded files, each backed by a verifiable on-chain commitment hash

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xbadr2/seedio.git
cd seedio
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Create a `.npmrc` file in the root with:
Run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Requirements

- [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app) browser extension installed
- Aptos Labs API key (from [developers.aptoslabs.com](https://developers.aptoslabs.com)) for Shelby Testnet API access
- Node.js 18+
